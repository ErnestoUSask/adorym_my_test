"""A lightweight 2D ptychography reconstruction module.

This package provides a minimal implementation of the ePIE algorithm for
ptychographic reconstruction.  It is intentionally compact so that the
core reconstruction logic is easy to read and modify without depending on
Adorym's larger code base.
